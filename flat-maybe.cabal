synopsis:            Strict Maybe without space and indirection overhead
description:
            Strict Maybe without space and indirection overhead.
            Inspired by Rust's Option, which is represented by
            either a pointer to the object or a specific "null" pointer.
            The implementation is a giant unsafe trick.
